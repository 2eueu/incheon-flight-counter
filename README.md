## üßë‚Äçüíº Motivation

> A friend working at the airport mentioned how time-consuming it is to manually count departing flights every day.  
> This project aims to solve that issue by building an automated system that fetches and visualizes departure data without any manual input.

## üéØ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Automatically retrieve and display the number of departing flights from Incheon Airport Terminal 2 (current day)
- **Framework**: Python + Streamlit Web App
- **Tools Used**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `Streamlit`
- **Deployment**: Currently tested on local macOS; automation possible with `crontab`

## üîß Development Steps

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 1: Initial Approach using Selenium
- Attempted browser automation using `selenium`
- Encountered driver issues & non-compatibility with Streamlit Cloud

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Problem Analysis
- Target site loads flight data via JavaScript
- Traditional `requests.get()` couldn't retrieve dynamic content

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Final Solution
- Analyzed network activity, discovered internal POST endpoint:  
  `https://www.airport.kr/ap/ko/dep/flightOrgList.do`
- Used `requests.post()` to collect structured flight data
- **Selenium removed** ‚Äî lightweight and deployable via `Streamlit`
